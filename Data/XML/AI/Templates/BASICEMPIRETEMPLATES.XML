<!--  	MAJOR ITEM PURCHASE TEMPLATES
 Sometimes we want to purchase major items during a fleeting window of opportunity.  These purchases
 require a template to ensure spending on occurs as fast as possible (no pause).  The template switch alone
causes the entire budget to be redistributed, with a heavy emphasis on the expensive item budget category.
A perception will determine the fraction of the current gross budget (cash on hand plus income stream) required to
build the item without interruption.  A desirability equation will decide if the item is wanted and if this fraction
is acceptable.  The same fraction percaption will be used in determining the expensive item budget and (1 - fraction) *
the normal working budget for other categories.  This will effectively cut their budget and cancel goals which can't
be maintained while we're making the major purchase.  If we have sufficient cash or income streams, unrelated goals won't
be cancelled.
